# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r label = pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Put something interesting or informative here"}
plot(pressure, col = "blue", pch = 19)
```

$$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{n}$$

The average pressure for the `pressure` data frame is `r round(mean(pressure$pressure), 2)` mm.




##Jared are you here?

The same mean is defined in Equation \@ref(eq:mean).

\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{n}
(\#eq:mean)
\end{equation}

Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:pressure)


#Insert URL

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQLndCNwLnsMqgZYJJL1Ndg751IGCRqW-KJ42rEjByHT0_OiaMU")

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
